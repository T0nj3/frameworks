# CSS Frameworks - Social Media App

This is a project where I used **Tailwind CSS** to build a responsive social media application with a focus on a mobile-first approach. The application includes authentication, a feed page to display posts, and a profile page where users can view and edit their information.

## Project Description

This project is a **social media app** prototype built using **Tailwind CSS** and **HTML** for styling. The application consists of three main pages:

- **Authentication Page (`index.html`)**: Includes a form to log in or register for the application. The form includes HTML form validation, and password requirements are set for a minimum of 8 characters.
- **Feed Page (`feed/index.html`)**: Displays a list of posts, with options to search and filter by popularity or latest posts. Users can create new posts via a form.
- **Profile Page (`profile/index.html`)**: Displays the user's profile, including their posts, a follow button, and statistics such as followers and following.

The design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using Tailwind’s utility-first CSS framework.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The application is designed with responsiveness in mind, using Tailwind's responsive utility classes.
- **Authentication**: Login and registration functionality.
- **Feed Page**: List of posts with thumbnails, and options to search and sort posts.
- **Profile Page**: User profile displaying posts, followers, and following information.
- **Interactive Elements**: Button toggles and modals to show and hide content.

3. Build the Tailwind CSS:
